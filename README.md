lpc8xx microcontroller development code base.

Should work with LPC810, LPC811 and LPC812.

It uses [LPCOpen 2](http://www.lpcware.com/content/nxpfile/lpcopen-software-development-platform-lpc8xx-packages) source code and inspired by [sebseb7/lpc8xx Makefile](https://github.com/sebseb7/lpc8xx) with arm-none-eabi toolchain.

Added some Arduino like compatible API, ino file can be compiled with ino2firmware.sh script.
